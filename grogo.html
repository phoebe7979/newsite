      <h6>THE PROBLEM</h6>
      <h2>How can I help 92% grocery shoppers save time shopping in the store?</h2>

      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        I almost always ended up spending much more time than I wanted shopping in the grocery store.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      US shoppers spend an hour per week shopping for groceries (The Time Use Institute, 2008). Considering over 92% of shoppers still shop in the store, something needs to be done to facilitate instore shopping time to give shopers back time lost doing such recurring task (ICSC,2018).
      <br><br>
      As one of the regretting shoppers myself, I took the challenge to design a solution that streamlines grocery shopping expeirence, giving shoppers back time lost during in-store grocery shopping.

      <h6>RESEARCH</h6>
      <h2>Explore the unknown about the in-store grocery shopping processes</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      I started by taking a step back to list down research questions yet to be explore about in-store grocery shopping.
      </p>
      <ol class = "lists">
      <li>How much time do people spend a week doing grocery shopping? How do they feel about it?</li>
      <li>What are people's common grocery shopping procedure? What do they spend most time on?</li>
      <li>What do the current solutions offer that solves the problem? What can't they solve?</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Small Sample Survey</h5>
      <p>
      I conducted a survey with 16 participants to learn their common shopping challenges. I learned that they also spent a long time shopping for grocery. In addition, people who consider spending much time share similar concerns.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <img class = "project-wide-img" alt= "survey" src = "imgs/grogo/survey.png"/>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      In addition, there are recurring issues they mentioned.
      </p>
      <ol class = "lists">
      <li>Having to return to previous aisles for a forgotten item.</li>
      <li>Difficulty locating an item in the store.</li>
      <li>Comparing similar items for too long.</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <h5>User Interviews</h5>
      <p>
        I interviewed four different shoppers individually. By having them walk me through their last grocery shopping experience, I uncovered different shoppers' motivations, grocery shopping styles, as well as other pain points related to inefficient shopping.
      </p>
      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        My husband is vegetarian, so I have to pay extra attention to what I buy.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        I have trouble finding a particular item.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        Food labels are too small. I spend too much time reading them.
      </blockquote>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Comparative Analysis</h5>
      <p>
        By comparing grocery-store apps and meal-prep apps, I noticed that grocery store apps have less sophisticated planning features, while meal prep apps or to-do list apps rarely include specific product information. The results implied a possible solution that includes the good of both application types.

      <h6>SYNTHESIS</h6>
      <h2>Summarizing research data to answer my initial quesitons</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      Now it's time to conceptualize from my research data!
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Causal Diagram</h5>
      <p>
        What is taking up much time in a grocery shopping process? I synthesized data from the interview and survey, and mapped out the causes in a diagram below. I decided not to tackle the traffic time due to solutions readily available on the market.

      <br><br>
      <h5>Personas</h5>
      <p>
        Who am I designing for? After distilling demographic data from the survey and interviews, I identified the primary and secondary personas that would love to optimize their grocery shopping tasks. The personas have distinct shopping behaviors in the store.
