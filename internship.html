      <h6>WHAT I DID</h6>
      <h2>Generative and evaluative research</h2>
      <p>
       Working as the only UX reesarcher within a team that developes at full-speed, I was very lucky to be able to work on research studies on different stages of the design process.
       <br><br>
       During th internship, I worked closely with my supervisors on identifying a new prodcut category's potential user groups and usage scenarios by means of literature review, workshop, and interviews. On the other hand, I conducted regular usability studies for new product features and provided data-informed suggestions for the designers at the team. I also had the chance to share my research findings with the whole company during the all-hands meeting. <br><br>
       Having the opportunity to work on both generative and evaluative resarch projects has allowed me to see the design process holistically. This has definitly been an invaluable experience. </p>

      <h6>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h6>
      <h2>Be proactive</h2>
      <p>
       As the only intern/researcher within the team, I had to conduct my studies independently most of the time. At times, this could be challenging as I wouldn't be able to get most immediate feedback, or just have someone that I can directly observe and learn how they deal with similar tasks.
       <br><br>
       With the goal to get the most out of this internship, I was inspired by a talk at San Francisco Design Week given by Alison Entsminger, the design lead at IBM "From Self-perception to Self-Awareness: Finding your Data, Feedback and Growth Potential", where she shared about how we should be open to collect feedback from others for a better iteration of ourselves. I tackled the above challenge by proactively asking for feedback and suggestions from my supervisors and teammates, who, although not currently working at a research role, have had research experience or have been very experienced working in the UX field, including working with researchers. From them, I was able to identify a lot of room for improvement of my research skills that I wasn't aware of before, as well as learning from success stories shared by my teammates.<br><br>
       Meanwhile, I also reached out to people from other teams at the company and shared with them about my project. </p>
